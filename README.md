This R program probablistically (fuzzy) matches 2 disparate datasets together by various demographic variables (once cleaned). After installing and running the appropriate libraries and importing the data, matching variables need to be cleaned with the same formatting. Once cleaned, data is match blocked from highly confident matches to low questionable matches. Levels of match confidence are subject to the fidelty of the data being matched, and feel free to customize ordering and labelling. Once matched, data is output to an xlsx format split into three tabs, one-to-one matches, many-to-many matches, and anti-join matches where no viable match was found. Enjoy!
